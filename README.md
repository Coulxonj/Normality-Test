# Normality-Test

# A Normality Test is a statistical procedure used to determine whether a dataset follows a normal distribution. Many statistical techniques, including t-tests, ANOVA, and linear regression, assume that the underlying data is normally distributed. This test helps to validate the assumption of normality, or if the data significantly deviates from a normal distribution, suggesting the need for alternative statistical methods or transformations.

## Key Features:
* Purpose: Assess if a given dataset follows a normal distribution.
* Statistical Tests Included: Shapiro-Wilk, Anderson-Darling, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, D'Agostino-Pearson, and others.
* Visualization: Generate Q-Q plots and histograms to visually inspect normality.
* Output: Provide a p-value indicating if the null hypothesis (data is normally distributed) can be rejected.
